## Tech Stack & Architecture 🏗️

I've built De Burgerlijke App using modern, battle-tested technologies:

### **Frontend & Mobile** 📱
- **Nuxt 3** - The intuitive Vue framework for production-ready apps
- **Vue 3** with **Composition API** - Reactive, performant, and developer-friendly
- **TypeScript** - Because I believe in type safety and better developer experience 💪
- **Capacitor.js** - Cross-platform mobile development that actually works
- **Ionic Vue** - Mobile-optimized UI components that feel native
- **Nuxt UI + Tailwind CSS** - Beautiful, responsive design system

### **AI & Data Processing** 🤖
- **Vercel AI SDK** - Powering my intelligent recipe parsing
- **OpenAI API** - For smart recipe enhancement and suggestions
- **Firecrawl** - Web scraping service for reliable recipe extraction
- **Zod** - Runtime type validation for bulletproof data handling

### **Architecture Decisions** 🎯
I've implemented **Clean Architecture** to ensure my app is:
- **Maintainable** - Clear separation of concerns across layers
- **Testable** - Every component has comprehensive unit tests
- **Scalable** - Easy to add new features without breaking existing code
- **Flexible** - Swap out external services without touching business logic

#### **Architecture Layers:**
1. **Domain Layer** - Pure business logic and entities
2. **Application Layer** - Use cases and application services
3. **Infrastructure Layer** - External APIs, databases, and frameworks
4. **Dependency Injection** - Clean, testable dependency management

### **Key Architecture Benefits:**
- 🔄 **Dependency Inversion** - External services are easily replaceable
- 🧪 **Test-Driven Development** - Comprehensive test coverage for confidence
- 📱 **Mobile-First Design** - Optimized for touch interactions and offline use
- 🔒 **Type Safety** - End-to-end TypeScript for fewer runtime errors

## Why Clean Architecture? 🏗️

I chose **Clean Architecture** because I believe in building software that lasts. Here's why it matters:

### **The Problem with Traditional App Development** 😕
- **Tight Coupling** - Change one thing, break three others
- **Hard to Test** - Business logic mixed with UI and external services
- **Difficult to Scale** - Adding features becomes increasingly complex
- **Vendor Lock-in** - Switching services requires rewriting large portions

### **My Solution: Clean Architecture** ✅
- **🔄 Dependency Inversion** - Core business logic doesn't depend on external services
- **🧪 Easy Testing** - Pure functions and clear boundaries make testing straightforward
- **📈 Scalable Growth** - Add features without touching existing code
- **🔀 Flexible Infrastructure** - Swap out APIs, databases, or frameworks without pain

### **Real-World Benefits** 🎯
- **Faster Development** - Clear patterns mean less time figuring out "where does this go?"
- **Fewer Bugs** - Separation of concerns prevents unexpected side effects
- **Better Collaboration** - Team members can work on different layers independently
- **Future-Proof** - Easy to adapt when requirements change (and they always do!)

*"It's not about being perfect from day one, it's about being able to evolve gracefully."* 🌱
